# Tweepy-Pond

I like ponds. This project was undertaken so I could monitor my homemade pond. The goal is to detect animal movement, take a photo of the ellusive beast along with some simple measurements (pond temp and air temp) and post it to its own twitter account. You can follow the development of this project, and eventually its application, at https://twitter.com/tweepy_pond. 

Most of the brains behind this project can be attributed to the CamJam EduKitSensor #2 pack (http://camjam.me/) and their associated worksheets. I simply mashed the lot together and added the camera/tweeting functions (which can be attributed to, in part, the PiCamera documentation http://picamera.readthedocs.org/en/release-1.9/.)
